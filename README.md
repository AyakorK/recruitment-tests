The purpose of these tests is to determine how you are approaching a situation. 

We know that you are a student, so it is normal that you do not know everything. We would like to hear from you what you want to learn during your time working with us, and what we could provide you with.

We have designed various categories of tests so that everyone can feel confident, it is interesting to try several of them. 

**Rules :**
* All tests are perfectly optional, pick one, two, or zero. We see them as a discussion, not a mandatory step.

**How to :**
* Fork this repo
* Start a new branch with a unique name
* Send a PR to this repo on master branch
* Resolve the levels in any order
* Update your PR accordingly

**Advices :**
* Feel free to write code without shame at first, then refactor it after. We all write nasty code at first, it's perfectly normal.
